== Setting up credentials ==

- Copy the credentials.py.template file to credentials.py
- Fill in your Snowflake login credentials between quotation marks

== Installing dependencies ==

- This assumes that you have terminal access and pip installed.
- Run pip -r requirements.txt in the command line

== Uploading CSV file ==

To upload CSV files to the warehouse, you'll need the "table_utils" and
"warehouse" modules:

    from table_utils import *
    from warehouse import Warehouse

If the table you want to upload to already exists, upload the CSV:

    reflected_table = Warehouse.reflect(<table name>)
    upload_csv(reflected_table, <csv_file>)

If you want to upload to a *new* table, you'll have to create it first:

    sql = create_table_stmt_from_csv(<csv_file>, <table name>, <schema>)
    Warehouse.execute(sql)

 Now you can call reflect() and upload_csv() for the table.
